//
// No separate email-OTP verification step (removed 2026-07-17, per

// real access codes (create-contract-invite) until Stephen or counsel has
// signed off on the wording.
//
// Deliberately does NOT collect a tax ID number (SSN/EIN) anywhere --
// tax_form_acknowledged is just Talent's acknowledgment that they'll
// provide a W-9 separately. Collecting actual tax IDs needs a properly
